<p><i>Justifications</i></p>		
<p>1. Group Work</p>

<p>Group chat function: Live chat discussion feature so students can discuss class material in live time during the lecture. Students can chat to work on group work/projects or to share their perspectives about the class material.</p>

<p>Why is this the best design? / Why were design choices made?</p>
<ul><li>Having a live chat feed would facilitate in-class discussions between students. This would help with group work because students can easily work with their peers in live time and send messages back and forth. </li>
	<li>Students would not have to move around the classroom to collaborate, which can be disruptive - they can just chat with their peers wherever they are seated and communicate via live chat. </li>
	<li>We felt like a simple interface where students can see who sends a message would be the best design because then, students can easily identify who sent the message. </li>
	<li>We considered a few different options for students to communicate in live time during class, such as a virtual sticky note board or just having students move by one another and then collaborate. We felt like a live chat design was the best and optimizes how students work together and give every student voice to contribute. (Leah, 2019)</li></ul>

<p>2. Class Discussion</p>

<p>Threaded forum layout: A threadlike discussion board that allows students to make a post, and then other students can follow up on the discussion post by replying to the discussion thread. </p>

<p>Why is this the best design / why design decisions were made?</p>
<ul><li>Design-wise, the original post would be featured at the top and then the discussion responses below it. This design allows students to easily find original posts, read replies on the same page, and join the discussion by clicking the respond button below the original post. The design here also includes the name of the author of the post so that users know who posted a discussion post and who replied. We went with the threadlike discussion board design because it improves how the class communicates and interacts with the class content. (Making good..., 2021)</li></ul>

<p>3. Ask Questions</p>

<p>Creating a post in the forum for questions: Discussion feed with follow-up discussion posts: A discussion feed with follow-up questions allows students to post their questions/comments about a topic for the entire class to view and respond to. Students can form a group and reply to the discussion post as a group. The responses to the original discussion post are listed below the original discussion post so that students and instructors can easily reference the original discussion post and new posts. </p>

<p>Why is this the best design? / Why were design choices made?</p>
<ul><li>Design-wise, this style of Q&A discussion allows students to quickly find the original discussion questions and then look at the posts posted by their peers and join the discussion. This type of design facilitates learning because students can learn from other students' posts and gain a new perspective on the class content. </li></ul>

<p>4. View Previous Discussions</p>

A discussion forum that allows students to view previous discussion posts. This allows the instructor to group discussion topics, and then students can reference the discussion post and responses later on. Students can access discussion posts using the sidebar, and important posts can be marked with a "pin." The pinned discussion posts will be moved to the pinned section so that students can reference information quickly in one location. (Insider..., 2021)

This is the best design because then students' responses to the discussions are not lost. The discussion responses are saved so students can reference the discussions later to review the class material. This is an intuitive design, and it is similar to other discussion forums where there is a sidebar that houses past discussion questions. When the user clicks on a particular discussion question, the discussion post opens, and the user can view the original discussion post and the responses.   


<p>Organize discussion board by topic: A discussion forum that allows users to easily filter posts by topic so that they can access the information they are looking for quickly <p>

<p>Why is this the best design? / Why were design choices made?</p>
<ul><li>Having a filter allows students to reduce the number of posts shown and focus on the post content that they need to look at. </li>
	<li>Students can organize the posts from oldest to newest or newest to oldest to get the latest information at the top of their feed.</li>
	<li>Students often need to find specific information in discussion forums, so with this design, they would be able to do a keyword or key phrase search to search through all of the discussion posts. After typing in the keyword or phrase and hitting search in the search bar, the result would filter and only display posts with those keywords.</li>
	<li>Design-wise, we considered other options to organize content such as just grouping posts by topic and not having a filter system - but we felt like having a filter system was the best design because then each student can filter the discussion forum to find specific information that they are looking for. </li></ul>

<p>5. Pin Key Threads</p>

<p>Forum / Threadlike System - where key threads can be pinned to the top using a simple interface - ie. Clicking the pin icon as an admin level inside the thread to pin them to the top:</p>

<p>Why is this the best design? / Why were design choices made?</p>
<ul><li>Similar to other discussion boards on the internet, pinned threads or “stickies” are pinned to the top given their sheer importance to users of the system.</li>
	<li>These pinned threads often contain crucial information and in a course setting, can be elements to a students success to bear in mind. Example - exams coming up, projects due, FAQs, assignments due, and general course information can be pinned here. </li>
	<li>Our design methodology is to use the tried and true method of clicking a “pin” icon to pin the threads with a designator symbol to signify that this thread is pinned to the top by the instructor / TA and should be looked at. </li>
	<li>The choice to go with a simple interface is to make the user experience for instructors as seamless as possible to allow them to focus on getting the work completed and conveying necessary information in a timely manner, rather than fiddle with the system to find the ability to pin these specific threads. </li>
	<li>While other designs could be used such as a checkbox to “place on top of board”, this would create unnecessary complexity to the system which is not coherent with the underlying focus on this UI to be simple, effective to use, with key signifers in place that bring a familiar feel to using the system.</li></ul>

	
<p>6. Facilitate Discussion</p>

<p>Piazza Like Interface - Students / Groups can work to discuss among themselves and extend the discussion as a class once done. </p>

<p>Why is this the best design? / Why were design choices made?</p>
<ul><li> Piazza is an example of a system that helps facilitate discussion well with its format being similar to an online discussion board. Thread topics can be made by students / instructors for which students / instructors can comment on and reply to specific responses and keep the discussion going.</li>
	<li>This is inherently the best design due to how well it works in keeping content placed in a relevant space.</li>
	<li>Inherently, when content is not placed in a coherent fashion, it may appear to be cluttered and as a result, can deter a user from using the system due to cognative overload, or attention that is all over the place. </li>
	<li>The design choice to opt for a Piazza like system allows for content to be placed strategically and coherently, in a method that just makes sense to use and follow through with. </li>
	<li>Students can contribute their own responses / Groups can respond collectively with other groups tagging into provide feedback or further the discussion. </li>
	<li>With larger in person classes, this can be a challange to hear out every student and what they have to say. This system is allowing for more students to voice their stance and using a system like Piazza that is tried and true, and gets the fundamentals right is key to ensuring a good user experience. </li>
	<li>The goal - have students focus on the the content, not the distractions. (Lorna..., 2019) </li></ul>
<p><i>User Story 6 not included in demo video because the outcome in design is the same as User Story 2. Please refer to User Story 2 (Class Discussion) in demo video for this section</i></p>

<p>7. Answer Questions</p>

<p>Answer questions through threads: Public questions asked would be answered and handled in a manner like on Piazza. Similar to student responses, instructor responses would be a one-up in the sense that they would have an instructor designator next to the response to indicate this came from an instructor. </p>

<p>Why is this the best design? / Why design decisions were made?</p>
<ul><li>Similar to a common style internet forum, moderators would have a “mod”, or administrators would have an “admin” tag near the response to indicate a special type of user responded to the question that was being asked. </li>
	<li>Instructors are often asked the same questions by different students, and offering the ability to ask public questions with this system, will allow for the instructor to reply one time to the question and simply link the response to a duplicate question and inform the user that this question was asked previously and to check the response curated. </li>
	<li>Inherently, these forums are in a public domain that can be viewed by anyone and the design implementation is similar in nature to what goes on with this style of discussion board. </li></ul>

<p>8. Endorse Responses</p>

<p>Answers Endorsed by Professor: With courses being led by instructors, having specific answers that are marked as “Endorsed by Professor X”, will provide students with the confidence that a specific answer was endorsed and chosen by the instructor of the course. </p>

<p>Why this is the best design / why design decisions were made?</p>
<ul><li>Particularly near the answer / response, there would be a label when an instructor endorses a response - similar to the system that is utilized with Piazza currently. </li>
	<li>It is implied that the instructor responses would hold much more weight and an endorsement would hold the same weight, similar to an instructors actual response. </li>
	<li>The design here would be to inform the user that the instructor has viewed and understood the response and has given the seal of approval on this answer being an answer that the instructor would also say if asked the same question or topic. </li></ul>

				<h4><br>B. Testing Protocol<hr></h4>
				<p><b>Research Question</b></p>
				
				<p>What is the effect of integrating the capabilities of a third-party system into a commonly used system regarding user engagement if the integration can mimic those capabilities of the third-party system?</p>
				
				<p><b>Methodology - Mixed Methods - Survey and Experiment</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Engage regular users of the prior systems, Piazza and eLC, with the new system to understand their workflow between these systems. </li>
					<li>Given the closely mimicked capabilities of the third party system to the new discussion board, understand how users are navigating this new system. </li>
					<li>Surveys would be provided after the short experiment of subjects using both systems to understand their feedback based on using both systems (prior and after), back to back.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Considers the user’s prior experience with using the third-party system to navigate a somewhat familiar system. </li>
						<li>Affords the ability to understand the user’s cognitive flexibility when it comes to seeking affordances and the key signifiers to accomplish some task (posting, asking questions, responding, engaging with the materials, etc).</li>
						<li>Seek common actions they engage in when using the two systems and how often they access certain features of the respective systems.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>

				
				<p><b>Testing Procedure</b></p>
				<p><i>What is your specific plan to deal with informed consent?</i></p>
				<p>Due to federal regulations, the informed consent would be documented via a signed consent form. This would ensure that the consent of the subject during the testing phase would be obtained and we have their explicit permission to perform this study with their contributions.</p>
				<p>The informed consent would contain:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Adequate information regarding the study would be provided to the subject to ensure they are aware of the study and its intended efforts. This includes</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Purpose</li>
						<li>Procedures Involved</li>
						<li>Risks</li>
						<li>Benefits</li>
						<li>Alternatives Available (if available)</li>
						<li>Opportunity to ask ample amounts of questions to address concerns that may arise.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Opportunities for questions regarding the study would be provided to the subject to ensure they are fully aware with their questions, concerns addressed prior to them engaging in the research phase.</li>
					<li>The voluntary agreement of the subject would be obtained with ample amount of time provided to give the subject time to consider.</li>
					<li>If needed, if the subject would be needing additional information as the study progresses, they would be provided ample opportunity to ensure they are comfortable in the entire process from A to Z.</li>
					<li>The signature of the subject would be obtained as a piece of their voluntary participation into the study.</li>
					<li>A copy of consent form with all the information discussed would be provided to the subject as an effort to ensure that the process is transparent.</li>
				</ol>
				<p><i>What specific data will you collect and how will it be organized?</i></p>
				<p>To preface, our subjects would include students and faculty who currently employ a system in place similar to what has been outlined with our project. As our system considers the different user types with their associated user stories, our goal is to understand data from both students and faculty respectively.</p>
				<p>Data Collected:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Time differentials in doing a similar task on the prior setup and the new system.</li>
					<li>Time to discover the capabilities of the new system in what can be accomplished.</li>
					<li>Overall satisfaction of the new system in terms of:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Ease of Use</li>
						<li>Aesthetics (Accessibility for Color, Text, Sizing, Formatting)</li>
						<li>Ability to tackle a common task related to both systems.</li>
						<li>Scale to understand potential featuritis with the new system.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Overall satisfaction with the prior system in terms of:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Ease of Use</li>
						<li>Aesthetics (Accessibility for Color, Text, Sizing, Formatting)</li>
						<li>Ability to tackle a common task related to both systems.</li>
						<li>Scale to understand if the current system exhibits featuritis.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Data between (3 and 4), would be compared to understand further relationships, trends, pain points, and related positives and negatives. </li>
					<li>Overall preferences - ie. “Do you prefer the new system, or to stick with the prior system?”</li>
					<li>Collect open ended feedback in regards to the new system that is not tied to a closed ended question (ie. Overall comments, concerns, likes, dislikes, potential aspects of improvement that would benefit them)</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Organization of Data:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Organize Quantitative Data into respective categories:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Scales presented during the study</li>
						<li>Satisfaction ratings</li>
					</ul>
					<li> Organize Open-Ended responses based on key related terms to understand common comments left between different subjects.</li>
					<li>Organize the collected data based on the user type of the subject -ie. if they are a student or a faculty member.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><i>What type of analysis do you intend to perform with the study data, and how will the analysis help answer your research question?</i></p>
				<p>Analysis: With the collection of qualitative data and open-ended responses, analysis would be performed on each of these data sets to understand commonalities among all participants.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What most found to be great, not great, pain points, scale ratings for satisfaction with the system, and dissatisfaction with the system. </li>
					<li>Understand potential edge cases with some subjects to understand if this would be a potential issue in the future, or if it is something that is miniscule and can be resolved with further documentation, training, or adjustments to the system. </li>
					<li>Setup data visualizations via graphs or charts to understand potential trends visually.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Analysis Answering Research Question:</p>
				<p>With the data collected and analyzed, our focus on curating the specific data collection was to understand overall user satisfaction with classroom learning inside and outside the classroom. Ie. How has the change with the system benefitted the user in regards to learning - would it improve, hinder, not change much. </p>
				
				<p><i>How might you conduct your testing procedure safely during a pandemic? </i></p>
				<p>With our project leveraging multiple digital tools and the system itself being a digitized system, we would employ the use of digital technologies to allow users to experience the new system from the comfort of their living space. All they would need is access to a computer. </p>
				<p>The experiment would be performed via a digital walkthrough that would take the user to the prototype in question. They would be provided the necessary information prior along with any helpful information to ensure the system is working as intended for all participants in the study. </p>
				<p>Similar to other studies done at UGA, we would use a Qualtrics system in place to collect the survey information. </p>
